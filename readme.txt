The PasswordComplexityChecker class creates a simple GUI with a label, an entry field for the password, a button to check the password, and a label to display the result.
When the user clicks the "Check Password" button, the check_password method is called.
The check_password method checks the password length, and if it's less than 8 characters, it adds a feedback message and doesn't increment the strength score.
The method checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If any of these criteria are not met, it adds a feedback message and doesn't increment the strength score.
The method determines the password strength based on the number of criteria met. If fewer than 3 criteria are met, the password is considered weak. If exactly 3 criteria are met, the password is considered medium. If all 4 criteria are met, the password is considered strong.
The method updates the result label with the password strength and feedback.
